                         be passed on so the art does not disappear in a world of fast fashion.

                        the art of bespoke craftsmanship. It instantly fuelled my own learning. She shared her expertise in the intricate processes of bespoke
                         cutting and tailoring with great patience and let me partake in an experience that profoundly formed my understanding of sustainable garment production.
                        As a child of my time, I feel incredibly blessed to have found a course that champions the heritage and
                        beauty of high-quality craftsmanship. It has empowered me to work independently, dedicating my skills towards a long-lasting, consciously produced alternative to fast fashion. I can only recommend the Level 5 Course.“

        <p>HI, I'M AMARA
            I’ve been a passionate advocate for sustainable style since 2015.  I watched the documentary the True Cost and I was forever changed.  I am by no means perfect, but I try my best to live by the values that are
